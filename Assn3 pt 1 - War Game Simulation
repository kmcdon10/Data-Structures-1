/* Directions: Use the Queue class in the alg13 package to simulate a simplified version of the playing card game frequently 
 * called War. The Queue represents a player's packet of cards and consist of Card objects, using the Card class provided in 
 class

Your version should have the following (simpler) rules:

When there is a tie, randomly choose (50% probability) which "player" winse.
Randomly determine (50% probability) the order of the cards that are randomly placed at the end of the random player's queue.
Rule #2 is important. Similar to the findings of this paper on the game, our simple version of the game won't terminate without the random placement.

Call your class War. Your main method should simulate 10,000 games and report the average number of rounds
