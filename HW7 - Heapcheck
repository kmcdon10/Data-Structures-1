/* Directions: Write a class called HeapCheck that has a method that takes an array of float values and indicates whether
 * the array represents a min-heap, a max-heap or no heap. If all values are the same, your code may simply indicate that 
 * it's a min-heap. Your main method should demonstrate that your code works correctly.
