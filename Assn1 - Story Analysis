/* Using the BagOWords class, write a program that analyzes these two short stores: The Cask of Amontillado and The Open Window. 
 * The program should produce a report with the following information:
 * The total number of words in the text
 * The number of different words
 * The ratio of the number of different words to the total number of words
 * The list of words (in any order) that occur more than 2% of the time and the percentage that they occur.
 * The main method of your program should write the report to standard output. 
 * You may assume that these two files are in the data folder
