/* Directions: Use the Queue class in the alg13 package to simulate a simplified version of the playing card game called War.
 * The Queue represents a player's packet of cards and consist of Card objects, using the Card class provided. 
 * Your version should have the following (simpler) rules:
 *  When there is a tie, randomly choose (50% probability) which "player" winse.
 *  Randomly determine (50% probability) the order of the cards that are randomly placed at the end of the random player's queue.
 *  Rule #2 is important. Similar to the findings of this paper on the game, our simple version of the game won't terminate without the random placement
 *  Your main method should simulate 10,000 games and report the average number of rounds
