/* Directions: Use the Stack class in the alg13 package to check if a file has matching HTML tags consistent with the XHTML
 * standard. You may assume the following simplications about the file:
 *  The file only consists of simple opening and closing tags.
 *  Tags just have simple identifiers (no attributes).
 *  All tags are separated with white space (so that the readAllStrings successfully tokenizes and separates the tags).
 * Using a stack of Strings, the following algorithm tests for properly nested XHTML tags:
 *  If the tag is an opening tag, push its identifier on the stack.
 *  If the tag is a closing tag, pop the stack and test if the resulting identifier matches that of the closing tag 
 *  (if not, it's not properly nested).
 *  If end of the file is reached and the stack is empty, then the file has properly nested tags (assuming all tests were 
 *  successful).
