/* Directions: (Part 1)Write a static method called scoreWord that takes a string as input. This method should take a string of 
 * upper-case letters including the blank ("_") character. If the given string is a valid word (present in the online dictionary)
 * it should return its scrabble score (see Wikipedia for tile scores for Scrabble in English). If the string is not a valid word,
 * it should return 0. Note that the blank character can represent any letter. You may assume that the string will have at most 
 * one blank character. For example, the method call scoreWord("QUICK") should return a score of 20, but scoreWord("ZXRT") should
 * return a score of 0 since it's not a valid word.
 * (Part 2) Write another static method, also called scoreWord, that takes two strings as input. The first string indicates 
 * the proposed word for scoring (as before). The second string indicates the squares for placing the word. These squares may 
 * have multipliers for a letter or the whole word. The string representing the squares uses the following codes:
 * Char Key: 'd' double letter score / 't'	triple letter score / 'D'	double word score / 'T'	triple word score
 * For any other regular square, don't apply a bonus
 * Ex: the method call scoreWord("QUICK", "d____T") should return a score of 90
